# PKSideMenuDetailContainerController
Storyboard supported container view controller for showing a menu and corresponding detail control. One of the primary UI of iOS mobile apps

# Introduction
This project consists of two modules.
- A container view controller for creating a side menu and detail view controller that you see in many applications. Using this you can easily create a container controller in storyboard and specify your own controlles for the left hand side which is usually a menu table and a detail controller which is usually hosted by a navigation controller. 
- A menu table view controller can be easily created using the PKMainMenu* classes which offers a plist based model for the menu and a highly configurable table view controller to render that menu.
